## Current Status
- **Phase 1**: Not started
- **Phase 2**: Not started  
- **Phase 3**: Not started

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Initialize frontend and backend projects
3. Implement basic photo capture functionality
4. Integrate with LLM API for initial testing

## Dependencies
- OpenAI API key or Anthropic API access
- Development environment with Node.js and Python
- Git repository setup
- Docker for containerization (optional for development)

## Simplified Scope Notes
- **No Authentication**: Application is for personal use only
- **No User Management**: No accounts, profiles, or history storage
- **No Database**: Stateless application with temporary image processing
- **Minimal Security**: Basic input validation and rate limiting only
