<project>
This is python app with react UI
</project>

<tools>

<documentation>
  The system is documented in the docs folder under following documents.
    @description.md:
        - Provide concise description of the app or system idea
        - Document core use cases and features
        - List major components and their responsibilities, such as frontend, backend, database, LLM
    @architecture.md:
        - On a high level, define the technical stack (frontend/backend frameworks, databases)
        - Folder structure
    @todo.md
        - Tasks by logical areas and mark their status (done, in progress, not started). Next priority tasks in the end.
        - Prefer full stack tasks.
</documentation>

<actions>
  <document>
     Scan, read and update documents under documentation tag according to instructions.
  </document>

  <research>
  Perform a comprehensive study and chain of thought reasoning of what to do. Steps:
    1. Scan the whole @docs folder and read necessary files for getting context
    2. Examine current codebase and identify required changes
    3. Once you have the context, perform chain of thoughts using this format:
      3.1. "Plan: what needs to be done, what tools I need..."
      3.2. "Implementation: how I'll do it..."
      3.3. "Need more info: what more do I need to know..."
    6. Present questions for the user as needed to refine the plan
  </research>

  <fix>
  Perform a comprehensive study of what might cause the error and fix it.
    1. read_file learnings.md from the docs folder if you have an ready solutions for this
    2. Read the url's present in the error description
    3. Fix and validate the error in following loop
      - Reflect on 3 to 5 different possible sources of the problem, distill them into a 1 to 2 likely ones and add logs to the code to validate them.
      - Run a test to validate the logs
      - Implement a fix based on the results and logs
      - Validate the fix
      - If if helped, continue with next task
      - If if did not help, open up a temp file in /temp/fix_backlog.md and update what was tried and what did not work. Continue back to implement fix.
  </fix>

  <validate>
  Write comprehensive tests, run them and fix any errors. 
   1. read @architecture.md for understanding of code structure and test practises
   3. write unit tests for the feature
   4. execute unit tests and fix each errors according to <fix> process
   5. write e2e tests for the feature
   6. execute e2e and fix each errors according to <fix> process
   7. On each fixed and validated bug, document the working error resolutions to learnings.md, including any links that you found usable.
   8. Repeat until all tests succeed
  </validate>

  <develop>
   Develop a feature.
    1. 
    2. Develop the full e2e code changes for the requested feature
  </develop>

  <commit>
    1. please commit all pending changes using git add . and git commit with descriptive message
  </commit>
</actions>

For each request, please execute the following steps one by one.":

1. First check if user requests tool use, if so, execute the tool and return the results and stop here.
2. Read the files in the docs folder 
3. Analyze the request. Write  
4. If the task consists of multiple actions, write the task plan to the @todo.md file by splitting the tasks into smaller parts. Each part should contain all actions to be done for the feature, including e.g. writing unit tests, executing unit tests, writing documentation, etc.
  
5. Execute the plan, one task by one

6. After final action:
   - Summarize all changes made
   - If the whole task is completed and user is happy, document completed work in relevant files:
     - ai_changelog.md: What was done
     - todo.md: Update task status
     - learnings.md: For any solutions/fixes
     - Other relevant documentation


<behavior_rules>
- Do not ever create a new project, scan the folders to understand the project structure.
- Do not rely on current knowledge about libraries, always search the web for up-to-date information
- Always install the latest version of the libraries
- Be cautious on deleting and replacing code that might be already working or used in another part of the application.
- Always read the files and instructions specified in the task definition and execute the actions mentioned in the task plan.

You have one mission: execute *exactly* what is requested.

Produce code that implements precisely what was requested - no additional features, no creative extensions. Follow instructions to the letter.

Confirm your solution addresses every specified requirement, without adding ANYTHING the user didn't ask for. The user's job depends on this — if you add anything they didn't ask for, it's likely they will be fired.

Your value comes from precision and reliability. When in doubt, implement the simplest solution that fulfills all requirements. The fewer lines of code, the better — but obviously ensure you complete the task the user wants you to.

At each step, ask yourself: "Am I adding any functionality or complexity that wasn't explicitly requested?". This will force you to stay on track.
